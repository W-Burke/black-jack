/* final notes
 * the game needs to start by shuffling the deck class so that its different each time
 * the deck class needs to replace the scanner input for the dealer and player hands with the deal method from 
 * the ruling on how aces, kings, queens and jacks work need to be added
 * more player options like split, double, surrender need to be added. Split will probably be the biggest hurdle
 * replace the scanner inputs to make decisions using buttons, the likes of split should only be available if you do have a pair
 * after player decisions are done deal 1 card to the dealer to show their remaining hand then have the dealer 
 * continue making decisions based off its ruleset (hitting on soft 7's)
 * add in win condition for natural blackjacks (it beats normal 21, ties against dealer natural blackjack)
 * replace the scanner inputs for whether you want to play again with buttons
